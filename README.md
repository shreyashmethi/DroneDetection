# Drone Detection Algorithm

Welcome to the Drone Detection Algorithm repository! This project aims to develop an algorithm for detecting and identifying drones in real-time using computer vision techniques. The algorithm utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning models and image processing methods to analyze video streams and identify potential drones.


## Introduction

Unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly known as drones, have gained significant popularity and usage in various domains. However, their increased accessibility has also raised concerns about privacy, security, and safety. This project addresses the need for a robust drone detection algorithm that can be integrated into existing surveillance systems, ensuring the early detection and prevention of unauthorized drone activities.

The algorithm employs computer vision techniques to process video streams and identify potential drones based on their visual characteristics such as size, shape, and motion patterns. By leveraging deep learning models and image processing algorithms, the system can detect drones in real-time and trigger appropriate actions or alerts.
